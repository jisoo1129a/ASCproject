            be able to in class. With the vast number of extracurriculars available at FA, \
            you are bound to find something which you love: something that drives and motivates you, \
            or something that simply brings you joy. Extracurriculars allow you to find your interests, \
            to cultivate them, and possibly even to set you down a path that will have a lasting, positive impact on your future."},

            but they can also complement your studies. If you are looking to get better at mathematics, \
            you can join the Math Team. If you want to enhance your artistic abilities, \
            there are numerous opportunities both musical and visual, from the Fryeburg Academy Big Band to learning Ceramics. \
            Every opportunity to pursue your interests outside of class improves your college resume, \
            makes you better prepared for the future, and breathes extra joy into your academic experience."}
