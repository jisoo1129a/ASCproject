How Extracurriculars Compliment Academics:;
Not only are Extracurriculars a way to pursue what you love, but they can also complement your studies. If you’re looking to get better at mathematics, you can join the Math Team.

Every opportunity to pursue your interests outside of class improves your college resume, makes you better prepared for the future, and breathes extra joy into your academic experience.
